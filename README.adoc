   --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
   neo4j:latest
..................
- open a browser and go to localhost:7474
- enter "neo4j" as the password

- Create a new relationship between those two nodes called “LIKES”.

- Find all your friends in the database. 
- Create a friend of a friend for one of your friends (you->friend->foaf) and make him an expert in your hobby.
